title: "Git Post Commit Hooks"
---

Have you ever found it difficult to remember what features or bugs you've spent the last week on? How about the 
past month, or even year?

I find it hard. Sometimes It can even be hard to remember what I did by the end of a day. Luckily we have computers to help us out.

Using git is a great way to track what you've done. If your commits are meaningful and frequent enough, fantastic - you can look back at these. These can behave as documented timelines providing context to your development. 
But it's not always easy to keep track of your commits:
- What if you're using more than one git repo? 
- What if these repos are under different Source Code Management System e.g. some are on GitHub and others GitLab? 
- How about if you squash commits after merging?

There is a range of issues that can increase difficultly in tracking them.

## How can we track all commits?

If all of these changes are being made under git, you can use [git-hooks](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks)!
 
These are small executable scripts you can write to trigger when you perform actions with git. They can even be written 
globally to trigger in every git repo on your machine.

Here is how to set up global post-commit hooks to write to record all commits.

## Global Post Commit Hooks

### 1. Initialize Global Template
Firstly, globally set up git to use templates from the directory `.git-templates`:

```shell script
git config --global init.templatedir '~/.git-templates'
```

### 2. Add Hooks Directory
Add a `hooks` directory. This is where all the global hooks can be stored:

```shell script
mkdir ~/.git-templates/hooks
```
### 3. Write Your Hooks ðŸ˜Ž
cd into the hooks directory, and create your hooks. For logging all my commits I use `git log` and write it to file:
```shell script
#!/bin/sh
# Replace the output path to your target destination
git log -1 > $HOME/commit-logs/all-commits.txt

```

Feel free to adapt the log to whatever meta-data you would like to document (I'd recommend keeping the commit times).

### 4. Make Hooks Executable
Don't forget to make your hooks executable, otherwise, they won't work!
```shell script
chmod +x ~/.git-templates/hooks/post-commit
```

### 5. Reinitialize Your Git Repos
You'll need to rerun `git init` in any existing git repos to get these new global updates. (This won't get remove of any 
of your local git hooks!)

## Conclusion

Keeping a centralised record of your commits is invaluable. This self-documenting method provides a tool for you to 
reflect on your work with contextual references on your thoughts at the time of writing.

And finally, this seamlessly tracks and logs the dev side of customer work! (If you're commits are meaningful of course ðŸ˜„).
