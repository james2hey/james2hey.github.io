title: "Hello, World"

Wherever you're reading this from, hello and welcome to my blog. I've created this for a variety of reasons, the main being 
to give myself a central place to document how I set up everything computer related. As a software engineer, 
I often find small knacks and tricks which speed up my day to day life. It can be easy to forget exactly how I've set 
these up as they aren't always common things e.g. when generating new ssh-keys, there are some use cli flags I like to add
to ease the process.

To maintain these as concrete details I've decided a personal blog would be best. Furthermore, other 
people might also find these knacks useful! As I continue to get these new ideas.

So there we have it, my first blog. I can officially say Hello, World ðŸ˜Ž
