Welcome to my blog. </p>\n<p>I've created this for a variety of reasons, mainly to give myself a central place to document how I set up all\nthings computer-related. I'm frequently finding new tricks and ideas to speed up day-to-day life as a\nSoftware Engineer. It can be easy to forget the details of exactly how I've set these up - they aren't always common\ntasks. For example, sometimes I need to generate a new shh-key, but I can't always remember the exact flags to use.\nSo why not just add this to a blog? Then I'll never forget.</p>\n<p>Who knows, maybe other people will also find these tricks and ideas useful? Other engineers and developers around\nthe world use similar tools and technologies to me, so perhaps these will help speed up some of their daily tasks as well.</p>\n<p>Anyway, there we have it.
